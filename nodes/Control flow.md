# Control flow

Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

---
Computers read code from top to bottom, from the first line to the last line, unless it hits any statement that changes the control flow such as loops, conditionals, etc.

We can control the flow of the program through any of the below structures:
- sequential (default mode)
- conditional statements (if-else, switch)
- exception handling (error handling)
- loops and iterations

In JS we have three conditional statements:
- if
- if-else
- switch
