# Interpreted language

---
An interpreted programming language is a language where code is executed line-by-line by an interpreted instead of being compiled to machine code before running it.

An interpreter reads your code and executes it directly.

Example programming languages:
- JS
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP
- Shell scripts (bash, etc.)
