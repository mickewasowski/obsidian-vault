---
- Syntax - mistakes in the code by the dev, invalid code that the parser cannot understand
- Logical - code syntax is correct but the output is inaccurate
- Reference - occurs when you try to access a variable that hasn't been declared
- TypeError - happens when a value is not the expected type
- RangeError - happens when a value is outside the allowed range (invalid array length)
- AggregateError - used with Promise.any() when all promises fail
