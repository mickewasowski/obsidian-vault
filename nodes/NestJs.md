# NestJS

Nest is compatible with both Typescript and JavaScript.
Combines elements from OOP, Functional programming, and Functional Reactive Programming.
Used for building server-side apps, uses progressive JS, and is built with and fully supports TypeScript.

### Initial project setup
```
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
nest new project_name --strict
```

The --strict flag creates a new project with Typescript's stricter feature set.
