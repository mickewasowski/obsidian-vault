# Heuristic

A practical rule or method used to solve problems or make decisions when a perfect solution is impractical, unknown, or too costly.

---
### In simple terms:
A heuristic is like a rule of thumb - it may not always give the best result, but it works well enough most of the time, and it's fast and efficient.

### Key characteristics:
1. Efficient - fast and lightweight to compute
2. Imperfect - may not always be optimal or correct
3. Pragmatic - designed to be good enough in real-world scenarios
4. Experience-based - often derived from observation or experimentation rather than strict logic
