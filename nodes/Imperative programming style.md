# Imperative programming style

---
Imperative programming is a programming style where you tell the computer *how* to do something, step by step, using explicit instructions that change the program's state.
Uses variables that get updated over time.
User `while`, `for`, `if` to direct the flow.
The focus is on the *process* and not just the result.
