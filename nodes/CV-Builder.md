# CV-Builder

This is a file with thoughts, structure, fyis and etc. about the project.

### Structure
1. Have a folder in src/ for template skeleton (each section's component with TSX structure)
2. Have a folder in src/ for each template's styling (more like a module structure)
3. Have some default colors defined in :root for each template
4. Implement redux state for managing all input fields, and the arrangement for each section
5. Allow for rearranging of the sections
6. Automatic page generation


### Input forms
1. Make the languages as selects (like in zety)
2. Make the certifications as dropdown menu to choose certification/license/training, place/issuer, issue date, area of certification, certificate URL (optional)
3. Make the hobbies input multiple inputs (start with one and then below have button to add more), and also add a delete icon on the right


### Home page
1. choose template
2. input forms for each section (some sections should be mandatory) with optional upload for image
3. next button to lead to the rendered resume page with all the collected data
4. allow the user to rearrange the sections
5. download button on the rendered resume page
6. back button (edit) to allow the user to edit what they want
