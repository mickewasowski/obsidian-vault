# Operating Systems

An OS is the core software system that manages all the hardware and software on a computer.
It's what lets you interact with your machine - from opening apps to saving files - without dealing with complex hardware instructions.

### What the OS does:
- manages CPU, memory, storage, and devices
- runs and organizes applications
- handles user input/output
- provides a user interface (GUI or terminal)
- enforces security and permissions


### How it works:
- Hardware => CPU, memory, GPU, etc. execute instructions
- OS => the OS acts as the translator and traffic controller between your apps and the hardware
- Apps => run on top of the OS, and focuses on your task
