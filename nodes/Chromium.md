# Chromium

Chromium is like a "base" or a "starter project"  for browser development.

### Chromium as a Browser "Foundation"
1. Chromium provides the essential building blocks for a modern browser:
	1.1.  Blink - rendering engine (for displaying web pages)
	1.2.  V8 JS engine (for running web apps fast)
	1.3. Networking, security, and extension APIs
2. It is open-source and companies/developers can customize it:
	2.1.  add proprietary (exclusive, personal) features like Google sync in Chrome
	2.2. strip out google services (Brave, Ungoogled Chromium)
	2.3. modify the UI/UX (Edge, Opera, Vivaldi)
3. No Bloat (no unnecessary features):
	3.1. auto-updates
	3.2. licensed codecs (H.264, MP3)
	3.3. telemetry - automatic collection and transmission of usage of data and system information from the browser to its developers. It's used to help improve performance, stability, security, and user experience.
