A programmer's best instrument.

A keyboard is a peripheral computer component used for typing.
It comes in different sizes, types of keys and colors.

The three most common sizes are desktop/full size, laptop size, and compact.
Compact is considered only the part with the letters and the number keys above the letters.
Most laptop sized keyboards don't have the numpad section.
Full sized contains all the keys including the numpad and the additional keys for deleting, inserting, etc.
