### Custom drink recipe

> "Feel" like energy drink:
- Caffeine: ½ capsule = too strong compared to NeuroGum. Try ¼ instead (or dissolve in water for precise dosing).
- L-theanine: 1 capsule = fine (a little higher, but beneficial).
- Vitamin B6: ¼ tablet = fine, though stronger than NeuroGum.
- Vitamin B12: ¼ capsule = fine, even though much stronger than NeuroGum.

> Closer to NeuroGum:
- Caffeine (GymBeam capsule, 200 mg) → ¼ capsule (≈50 mg, close enough)
- L-theanine (GymBeam capsule, 100 mg) → 1 capsule
- Vitamin B6 (GymBeam tablet, 10 mg) → ¼ tablet (≈2.5 mg)
- Vitamin B12 (GymBeam capsule, 100 µg) → ¼ capsule (≈25 µg)
