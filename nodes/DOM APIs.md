# DOM APIs

---
HTML DOM allows Javascript to access all elements in the HTML document and change them.
You can add/remove elements, add attributes, CSS styles, etc.

All browsers have built-in Web APIs for more complex operations such as:
- Geo-location API
- Permissions API
- Storage API
- Web History API


With these APIs you can ask the user for permissions to:
- access microphone/camera
- access your geo-location
- access and modify your local storage
