# Touch typing

Touch typing is a typing skill where you use each of your fingers to type.

---
When learning to touch type you might find it frustrating because you are unfamiliar with the correct finger placement. At first you will be slow but what you want to do is build accuracy, then the speed will come on its own.

The most important thing is to always place your two index fingers on the F and J letters. The rest of the fingers should be placed on the letters next to them as so:

As you can see from the image above each finger is responsible for a different set of keys:
**Left hand**
1. index - F G V B R T 4 5
2. middle - D C E 3
3. ring - S X W 2
4. pinky - A Z Q 1 SHIFT TAB CAPS ~ CTRL

**Right hand**
1. index - J H M N U Y 7 6 
2. middle - K , I 8
3. ring - L . O 9
4. pinky - ;  '' / P [ ] 0 - = \ ENTER SHIFT BACKSPACE CTRL

The rows with letters F and J are called the home rows.
You can always find the correct placement for your fingers by searching for the protruding dots on the keyboard on the F and J letters.
