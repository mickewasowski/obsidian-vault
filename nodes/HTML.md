### Client-side form validation
The form data needs to be validated before it is sent to the server.
When the user is on a website and starts entering data in the input fields, if the data is not in the expected format, or doesn't meet the requirements, usually the user is presented with a text explaining what is wrong - this is called *form validation*.

Validation done in the browser is called *client-side validation*.
Two types of validation:
- HTML
- JS

When an element is valid the element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements.
If the user tries to send invalid data, the browser will block the form submission and display an error message.
