### Versions

JS versioning is primarily governed by the ECMAScript (ES) specification, which standardizes the language.

ECMAScript - scripting language specification standardized by ECMA International. JS is an implementation of this specification.
The first edition was in 1997. Each version introduces new features, syntax improvements, and enhancements.

Since ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), ECMAScript has adopted an annual release cycle, with new features being added each year. Versions are often referred to by their year of release (e.g. ES2015, ES2016, etc.).

> Significant ECMAScript Versions
> ES5 (2009) - introduced strict mode, JSON support, and array methods like `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`.
> ES6 (2015) - major updated that added features like:

```
- Arrow functions
- Classes
- Template literals
- Promises
- Modules
```

> ES7 (2016) - introduced `Array.prototype.includes` and the exponentiation operator (`**`)
> ES8 (2017) - added `async/await` for better asynchronous programming and `Object.values` and `Object.entries`
> ES9 (2018) - introduced rest/spread properties for objects and asynchronous iteration
> ES10 (2019) - added features like `Array.prototype.flat` and `Object.fromEntries`

### How to run JavaScript

1. JS can be run in the browser by including the external script file using the `script` tag
2. Writing it within the HTML page using the `script` tag again
3. Running it in the browser console
4. You can also use REPL.
