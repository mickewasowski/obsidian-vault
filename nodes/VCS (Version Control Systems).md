# VCS (Version Control Systems)

Allows developers to track and manages changes of their code over time.

---
Version Control Systems, such as Git, Subversion, Mercurial, etc., are systems which allow developers to track and manages changes of their code over time.
The structure is non-linear, which allows for multiple people to work on features simultaneously.
VSC provides features such as branching for parallel development, merging to combine changes, and reverting to previous states of the code.
VCS also provides backup and recovery capabilities, conflict resolution, and the ability to tag specific points in history.

VCS is now an essential part of modern software development, enhancing productivity, code quality, and team collaboration.
