# Comparison operators

---
Comparison operators are the operators that compare values and return true or false.
Operators:
- `>`
- `<`
- `>=`
- `<=`
- `==`
- `===`
- `!=`
- `!==`
The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JS attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison. This behavior generally results in comparing the operands numerically.
The sole exceptions are `===` and `!==`, which perform strict equality and inequality comparisons both for value and type.
