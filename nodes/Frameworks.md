Frameworks are toolkits for building web applications.
They are sets of libraries that help create software or websites.

### Frontend Frameworks

1. React - is a JS library from Facebook for building UIs, especially for single-page apps.
- lets you create reusable UI components
- uses virtual DOM and has one-way data flow
- can be used with Redux/MobX/Zustand for state management
- can be used with React Native for mobile apps development


2. Vue.js - is a JS framework for building website interfaces.
- uses templates and virtual DOM
- has reusable components


3. Angular - created by Google.
- uses Typescript to create large SPAs where content *loads in one go* without needing to reload the whole single-page
- uses reusable components
- has two-way data binding, dependency injection, strong template system


4. Svelte - JS tool for building UIs.
- does it's main thing during build time, not in the browser
- turns code into small, fast, plain JS files
- uses components and has a simple syntax
- NO virtual DOM


5. Solid.JS - very fast and efficient.
- updates only the parts of the page that need change
- NO virtual DOM => directly changes the DOM
- similar syntax to React


6. Qwik - new tool for making websites load fast.
- uses "resumable" idea, apps start with very little JavaScript
- only loads code for interactive parts when needed
