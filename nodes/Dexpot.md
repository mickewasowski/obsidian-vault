# Dexpot

Virtual Desktop Manager app.

---
Virtual Desktops are supplementary work spaces for Windows.

You could use this to implement commands that would work in a similar way to the ones in [[Extension Manager]] on Linux.
You can configure keybinds to move a window to a different desktop.
You can also setup the default number of desktops to start with.

Very useful for declutter of your main workspace. You could separate your desktops per use or however you like.
