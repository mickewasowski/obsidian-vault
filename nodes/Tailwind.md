# Tailwind

CSS Framework gives you lots of small ready-to-use style classes.

---
### Pros
- write classes directly in your HTML without needing to write CSS
- designed for mobile first
- automatically removes any unused styles to keep your website's files small
- can be used in tailwind styled components


### Cons
- can make HTML bulky and unreadable
- if you need a more custom solution you'd have to write a custom class or CSS altogether
