# VCS

Version Control Systems allow for multiple versions of a project to exist simultaneously, making it easier to collaborate and maintain a record of all modifications.

---
Version Control Systems allow developers to track and maintain code over time.
Allows for parallel development with branching, history of modifications, merging to combine changes, reverting to a previous state.
Git is the most popular VCS, along with Subversion (SVN) and Mercurial.
VCS facilitate collaboration through remote repositories, pull requests, and code reviews.
Supports conflict resolutions, merge requests, provides backup.

Records to changes to all files, documents, code, configuration files, etc., and stores them in a repository.

Ensures that changes are organized, recoverable and easily managed.

###### Differences between VCSs:
- Mercurial has similar architecture to Git, has more centralized approach and does not use hashes to track changes.
- Subversion is a centralized VCS, which requires a central server to manage the repositories.
- Perforce is a commercial VCS that's designed for large-scale projects. Uses centralized approach, and provides tools such as build automation and issue tracking.
