# Conditional operators

A.K.A Ternary operator

---

Conditional operator (also known as Ternary operator) is the only JS operator that takes three operands.
The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.

`condition ? val_for_true : val_for_false` 

You can use the conditional (ternary) operator anywhere you would use a standard operator.
