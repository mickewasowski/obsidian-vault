# Training Rules (12+ weeks)
- Intensity cap (first 2 weeks): keep everything at RPE 6-7 (about 3-4 reps in reserve)
- Then progress slowly: weeks 3-4 at RPE 7-8 (about 2-3 reps in reserve), no forced reps
- Pressing range: use floor press and incline push-ups first; delay deep deficit push-ups until fully comfortable
- Rest: 45-75 sec between sets, 75 sec between blocks
- Tempo when 10kg feels light: 3 sec down, 1 sec pause, controlled up

# 4-Week Progression
- Week 1: minimum sets listed, RPE 6-7, no exercise to failure
- Week 2: add 1-2 reps on most sets, keep same load and form
- Week 3: add one set only to first exercise of each day, RPE 7-8 max
- Week 4: keep sets, use slower tempo and controlled range where needed

If recovery is smooth, repeat this cycle and gradually bring chest/back days to full 25-30 min.

# Time-Saving Format (if very busy)
Use this quick format to finish in about 20-22 min:
- Pick first 3 exercises of the day
- Do 2-3 sets each
- Rest 45 sec
- Keep 2-3 reps in reserve
