C Language - Basics - Data Types - Pointers - Arrays - Structs - Memory Allocation - Strings - Function Pointers

1. ## C LANGUAGE (for DSA + Systems)

> 1.1. C Basics

Compilation (gcc, clang)
Structure of a C program
Header files, include guards
main function, return codes


> 1.2. Data Types & Memory Layout

Primitive types (int, char, float, double)
signed vs unsigned
sizeof operator
stack vs heap memory
endianness (optional, useful later)


> 1.3. Pointers

pointer declaration (int \*p)
referencing vs dereferencing (&, \*)
pointer arithmetic
pointers to arrays
pointers to pointers
void pointers


> 1.4. Arrays

static arrays
dynamic arrays
iteration
array decay to pointer


> 1.5. Strings

null-terminators
C-string functions (strlen, strcpy, strcmp…)
buffer overflows (very important)


> 1.6. Dynamic Memory

malloc, calloc, realloc, free
memory leaks
segmentation faults
creating resizable structures


> 1.7. Structs

defining structs
pointers to structs
accessing fields with . vs ->
representing nodes in data structures


> 1.8. Function Concepts

pass-by-value
passing pointers to modify data
function pointers (optional but useful)


> 1.9. File I/O (optional for now)

fopen
fread/fwrite
fclose
