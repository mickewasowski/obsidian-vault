# Object prototype (JS)

The very core of OOP in JS.

### Object prototype
JS is an object-oriented language built around a prototype model.
In JS every object inherits properties from its prototype, if there are any.
A prototype is simply an object from which another object inherits properties.
>Prototypes form the very core of OOP in JS.
