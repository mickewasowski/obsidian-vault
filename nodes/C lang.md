### Overview

1. What is C?
- C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programmin language that supports structured programming.
Imperative means that it is organized around statements and variables (explain what to do).
- it is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time
- C is a modern language:
    - has most basic control structures and features of modern languages
    - designed for top-down planning
    - organized around the use of functions (modular design) structured programming
    - a very reliable and readable program
2. Usage
- C is used on everything from minicomputers, Unix/Linux systems to pc's and mainframes
- C is the preferred language for producing work processing programs, spreadsheets and compilers
- C has become popular for programmming embedded systems
    - used to program microprocessors found in automobiles, cameras, DVD players, etc.
3. Early on
- C has and continues to play a strong role in the development of Linux
- C programs are easy to modify and easy to adapt to new models or languages
- In the 1990s, many software houses began turning to the C++ language for large programming projects
- C is a subset of C++ with object-oriented programming tools added
    - any C program is a valid C++ program
    - by learning C, you also learn much of C++
- C remains a core skill needed by corporations and ranks in the top 10 of desired skills
- C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and thus is used by programs that were previously implemented in assembly language
    - provides low-level access to memory (has many low-level capabilities)
    - requires minimal run-time support
- was invented in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories
    - Ritchie was working on the desing of the UNIX OS
- was created as a tool for working programmers
    - main goal is to be a useful language
    - easy readability and writability
4. History
- C initially became widely known as the development language of the UNIX OS
    - virtually all new major OS' are written in C and/or C++
- C evolved from a previous programming language named B
    - uses many of the important concepts of B while adding data typing and other powerful features
    - B was a "typeless" language - every data item occupied one "word" in memory, and the burden of typing variables fell on the shoulders of the programmer
- C is available for most computers
- C is also hardware independent
- by the late 1970s, C had evolved into what is now referred to as "traditional C"
- the rapid expansion of C working on many different hardware platforms led to many variations that were similar but often incompatible
    - a standard version of C was created (C89/C90, C99, C11)
- a program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any platform with a standard C compiler
    - non-standard C programs may run only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler
- C89 is supported by current C compilers
    - most C code being written today is based on it
- C99 is a revised standard for the C programming language that refines and expands the capabilities of C
    - has not been widely adopted and not all popular C compilers support it
5. Standards
- the current standard is commonly referred to as C11
    - some elements of the language as defined by C11 are optional
    - also possible that a C11 compiler may not implement all of the language features madated by the C11 standard
