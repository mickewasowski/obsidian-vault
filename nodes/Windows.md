Windows provides a GUI (graphical user interface) where users can open apps, manage files, browse the web, and more - all through windows, icons, menus, and a taskbar.
Windows manages hardware like your CPU, memory, and storage, and acts as a platform for running software like browsers, games, and development tools (e.g. VS Code, Node.js).
