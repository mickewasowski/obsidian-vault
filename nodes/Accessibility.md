# Accessibility

Website accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites that can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities.

Some of the key features a website should have when implementing accessibility are:
1. text alternatives for images
2. ensuring keyboard navigation
3. using sufficient color contrast
4. offering captions for audio content
5. creating consistent and predictable layout

### Polyfill
A **polyfill** is a piece of code (usually JavaScript) that implements a web platform feature in browsers that don’t natively support it. It “fills in” missing APIs—acting as a shim—so you can use modern HTML, CSS, or JavaScript features without breaking compatibility for older environments. When a browser already implements the feature, the polyfill steps aside and defers to the native behavior.
