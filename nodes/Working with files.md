# Working with files

In Linux everything is a file: texts, images, systems, devices and devices.

Linux provides multiple command-line utilities to create, view, move or search files.
Some of the basic commands for handling files are:

- `touch` for creating
- `mv` to move
- `cp` for copying
- `rm` for removing
- `ls` for listing files and directories

### Copying and renaming files

`cp` used to copy a file or directory
`-r` flag is used when copying a directory, this way it recursively copies it's contents

`mv` is used to move/rename files or directories

> Both commands use the following structure:
`command source destination`
