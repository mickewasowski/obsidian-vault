# NoSQL

Stands for Not Only SQL

---
Breaks away from the rigid (not flexible) table-based structure of relational databases to offer flexibility, scalability, and speed.

### Best for:
1. Real-time analytics
2. IoT
3. Mobile apps
4. Distributed systems

### Key features:
1. Schema-less - you can store different fields in different records
2. Horizontal scalability - easily scale out across multiple servers
3. High performance - optimized for fast read/write at scale
4. Flexible data types - supports arrays, nested objects, etc.
5. Eventual consistency - some NoSQL trade strict consistency for speed
