# Linux

Linux is an open-source Operating System. It is widely used in servers, development, and embedded systems.

---
Under the hood Linux is a kernel - the part that talks to the hardware.

Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. are called distributions (distros) that bundle the Linux kernel with useful software and tools.

It is open-source and it free. It is stable and secure.

Where it's used:
- servers
- android (based on the Linux kernel)
- raspberry pi and IoT devices
- dev environments (especially via [[WSL]] and Docker)
- supercomputers
