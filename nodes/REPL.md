# REPL

Read-Eval-Print-Loop is an interactive shell that processes Node.js expressions.

---
The shell *reads* JS code the user enters, *eval*uates the result of interpreting the line of code, *prints* the result to the user, and *loops* until the user signals to quit.

Simply open a terminal and write `node`, then start writing JS code and hit enter to execute it.
