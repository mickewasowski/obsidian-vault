3. To use the component you just created go to Assets and drag-and-drop the component where you need it. Keep in mind you can change the text inside

> When creating a new state and you've used a variable for the color, when you want to change it for another state you need to click the "break link" button on the color:

This is a very useful plugin to get images for backgrounds.


### Auto layout

Clicking on one element, holding shift key, and then clicking on another element, then clicking on auto layout groups the elements together.
This way you can adjust spacing between the elements, move them together to rearrange your page, etc.


### Components

You can build your own custom components like for example buttons.
You can create a frame, then add text and/or icon inside.
Then you select all elements holding the shift key, then at the top right corner click "Create component".
Now extract it somewhere, like for example on a separate frame where you'd keep all your custom components.
Now you can create different variants, also different variants depending on a state (hover, click, etc.).
Then you can reuse the button type you've created by drag-and-drop from the Assets tab:
